# WordPress Android Media Publication Platform #
This is a free platform that allows organisations and societies that produce newspapers, magazines and other printed media
with articles to easily customize a pre-built Android application that grabs articles(posts) published on their WordPress
website.

## Requirements ##
As mentioned above, a WordPress CMS website is required. Access to the server the website and corresponding database for
the website is also required, as a server-side python application is requred to be installed and run to respond to Android
application requests.


## Note ##

The application is pre-configured as an example for Trinity College Dublin's student newspaper, the University Times.

This platform was developed by Computer Science Students taking module CS3013.
